            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                    Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                    occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 
                    8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, 
                    salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour 
                    milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring 
                    until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add 
                    Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is 
                    melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
